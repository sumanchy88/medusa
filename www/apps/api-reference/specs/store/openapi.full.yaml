        Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.

        ### How to Obtain the Cookie Session

        If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when the customer is logged in.

        If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in the cookie manually.

        To do that, send a request to [authenticate the customer](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:

        ```bash
        curl -v --location --request POST 'https://medusa-url.com/store/auth' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "supersecret"
        }'
        ```

        The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:

        ```bash
        Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;
        ```

        Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:

        ```bash
        curl --location --request GET 'https://medusa-url.com/store/customers/me/orders' \
        --header 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'
        ```

        Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.
